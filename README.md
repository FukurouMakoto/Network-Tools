# Network-Tools
A handy script for quickly finding network information. With just an IP address and your Subnet's CIDR, you can quickly find your subnet  mask, network address, broadcast address, and your usable IP range.

### Instructions
1) Clone project
2) run main.py
3) Follow the printed instructions
4) It's that easy!

### Future Additions
I want to be able to run the program on the command line with flags like a traditional Linux program at some point. More research will be needed. I would also like to eventually create a GUI program for this as well.
